# Image Classification with R
The objective of this project is to classify large amounts of images using R. The classification is to be made using 4 different models:

* Na√Øve Bayes
* Random Forest
* Deep Learning
* Support Vector Machines

### Requirements 
To succesfully use this project, you need a large compilation of images that are separated in at least 2 folders, each folder representing a class to be classified. The images need to be stored on a local directory. For this project we have two folders stored locally one with pictures of cars , obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/senemanu/stanfordcarsfcs#01002.jpg), and another file of pictures that are not cars, obtained from the [Visual Genome](http://visualgenome.org/api/v0/api_home.html).

#### Libraries
The following libraries are required:
* `library(imager)`
* `library(tidyverse)`
* `library(h2o)`
* `library(kernlab)`

### The Process
The script `GetNumbersImages.R` uses the library `imager` and takes in two folders of images and returns a .csv file that has a column called `Label` and 75 other columns of features for each image in those directories. 
The script `ImageClassifer.R` takes in the csv file called `images.csv` generated by `GetNumbersImages.R` and usues the libraries `h2o` and `kernlab` to build classification models and return Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and Overfitting (AuC)

### How it works
The script `GetNumbersImages.R` uses the formula `getNumbers` wich transfors a image to a single row of numbers with a label using the following process:
1. Load the image, detect its edges, and rezising it to a standard 50x50px
2. Convert the image a data frame with 4 colomns x, y, cc, and value. X & Y represent a coordinate for each pixel of the image, cc consists of factors for R,G,and B, and value represents the R,B,or G value of that pixel.
3. Group the pixel groups by 10 per main color, resulting in 25 pixel groups per color which generates the 75 variables used in the models.
The script binds each generated row together and writes a csv file called `images.csv`

The script `ImageClassifer.R` uses `h2o` to generate the Naive Bayes, Deep Learning, and Random Forest models, and it uses `kernlab` to generate the Support Vector Machine model.
